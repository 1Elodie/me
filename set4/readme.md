    The \n in the code is a newline character. 

    upperBound = input("Enter an upper bound: ")
    ----- enter an upper bound: 5
    print(f"OK then, a number between 0 and {upperBound} ?")
    ----- ok..... between 0 and 5?
    upperBound = int(upperBound)
    ----

    while ture:
        try:
            return
        expect 
            print

    reflection: By constantly asking ChatGPT questions and trying to understand the purpose of each piece of code, I finally feel like I have truly begun to grasp the basics. There are many ways to use code, and I tend to forget them, so I have repeatedly asked the same questions. I feel like ChatGPT might be getting annoyed with me. Compared to Set3, I spent much less time on Set4, my understanding speed has increased, and my debugging skills with ChatGPT have also improved a lot.
